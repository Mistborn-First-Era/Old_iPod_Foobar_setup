(Try without uninstalling first if you have it very customized, it may be avoidable in some cases.) - Uninstall old foobar2000 if you have it installed already. 
Uninstall old iTunes 
Install foobar2000 1.4 from website or provided files.
Install iTunes v3.1.0.62 - I couldnt find this version online so I got the version closest to it after its release. If you don't trust the provided file try to find it yourself it was hard to find and my computer doesn't trust it probably due to an outdated certificate.
close Itunes
Open foobar *1.4* (check version it's easy to open the wrong one if you didn't uninstall your original foobar download)
File -> Preferences -> component -> Install component -> foo_dop-0.7.2 provided (or find online)
Enable "mobile device support" in the iPod component advanced settings in the preferences tab
Plug in iPod and then use File -> iPod -> Load Library

If there was an error when foobar opened and it mentions "Apple Mobile Device Support" you need to reinstall iTunes (the old version that is provided)
If there was an error when installing iTunes that mentions rebuilding using a newer version of some preinstalled file you need to uninstall iTunes and then use Everything to search your computer for that file and manually delete it. Then reinstall the old Itunes again.
I don't know how to resolve other errors that may occur, use the wiki link provided on the second line if you have them and good luck.
